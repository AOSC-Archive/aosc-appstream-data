# aosc-appstream-data
Distro-specific Appstream data XMLs for software frontends running on AOSC OS. Two of the most used examples are:

- GNOME Software  https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software
- KDE Discover    https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.4.95.php

And all these requires an AppStream standardized XML catalog. More about the standard of this file can be found at http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Distributions/AppStream/.

**This is a repository containing automatically generated data, generated by `appstream-glib`.**

## Directories
A generic directory walk through.

- `xmls/` contains all XML catalogs.
- `icons/aosc` contains cached icon files.

And all to be installed to `/usr/share/app-info` and provided by a package available to AOSC OS users. Check https://github.com/AOSC-Dev/aosc-os-abbs for more updates.
